# AoC
Advent of code solutions in python (and a few in rust).
The solutions here are first tries without lookng at other solutions, so for most days there are probably better ways of solving them.

## Log
2019: Went back 2020 and did a few while trying out rust
2020: First year competing, completed on time 
2021: Skipped the last few days, went back 2022 to finish
2022: Completed on time
